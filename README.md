# About
[Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (RPN) is a notation for math formulas where operands precede their operators.  Computers have difficulty parsing traditional (a.k.a. "infix") notation, because it requires a computer to read back and forth throughout the string representing the expression.  This webapp (built with ReactJS and ExpressJS) converts a formula in infix notation to RPN before solving it.  RPN has applications in calculators, and I use a modified version of the converter in my [truth table generator](https://github.com/lstach/Truth-Table-Generator-JavaFX).

This is a comprehensive refactor of a previous project I worked on [here](https://github.com/lstach/Reverse-Polish-Notation).
